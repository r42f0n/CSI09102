Creative Technology   Project   (Phase   1 and 2)
Assessment Details:
Phase   1   Project BriefFor your assessment you will design and implement an   Interactive Virtual   Exhibit. Your exhibit will become part of the Creative Technologies   Online   Gallery.    Phase   1   is worth 60% of the overall   mark.
You will   implement the exhibit using the   Unity 3D game engine, as   used   in   the   practical sessions of this module.
You will be provided with an optional quick-start   template   unity   project   that will   provide the bare-minimum necessary to create your exhibit.
You can customise the template as much as you   want   to   fit   your vision   and   the   design of your exhibit. The concept of a ‘Room’ is used only as   an   indicative starting point. You can stretch this definition as far   as   you   want.Your exhibit must be suitable for a family audience   and therefore   must   not   contain   any sexually explicit images, animations, video or sounds.   It must   also   not   contain   any content that represents bodily harm or   people   in   danger of trauma.
The   Module leader reserves the right to make   the   determination   of whether the   work and content meet   these   requirements.
Timeline    Deadline   Dates:
The deadline for the   Phase   1 submission   is: 6th    December 2024 at   15:00
Proposal   Presentation
Mid-way through the trimester you will present a proposal for your exhibition   during a   practical.
Your proposal must be a short   1   slide   presentation that   outlines   your   exhibition   design.
The   presentation should last between   1-2 minutes to   allow time   for feedback.
The format of the   presentations may be modified. The   most   up to   date   specification will be on the   Moodle.
